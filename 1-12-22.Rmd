This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

R code chunk:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Python code chunk:
```{python}
print("Hello World!")
```

Click the save button to name this file.

The end.

Going to click Knit and Knit to Word to generate this as a .docx file.

Could also click the blue circle Publish button to generate a web link to access this file. (Need to Knit to HTML first?)
Afterwards, can still make edits and then Republish.
